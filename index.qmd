### About me
I’m passionate about connecting data science and computational methods with society. I am currently exploring how digital technologies can help us uncover new insights into political polarization and social change. My goal is to bridge rigorous research with meaningful public conversations, sparking ideas that lead to smarter, more compassionate policies.
