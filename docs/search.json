    "title": "How significant is One Piece for The Jolly Roger protest in Indonesia?",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Popular culture has evolved beyond mere entertainment; it has become a significant medium for self-expression and social connection. In Indonesia, a surprising symbol of rebellion, adventure, and resistance against oppression has emerged among protesters. But how strong is the symbolic significance of this emblem? In this post, we will explore how data from the entertainment industry can illuminate the role of One Piece in Indonesia’s protests. By employing causal inference methods and data from Parrot Analytics, we aim to determine whether the popularity of this fictional world reflects real-life actions and what this reveals about the relationship between pop culture and social change.\n\nQuick context on Indonesia and the recent protest.\nRecently, Indonesia has seen a wave of protests fueled by economic and political frustrations, along with rising uncertainty about the future. Since late July, truck drivers in the country have started waving the Jolly Roger flag as a way to protest new transport regulations. What began as a viral trend on social media quickly turned into a collective movement, with demonstrators nationwide raising the flag to symbolize their discontent during Indonesia’s 80th National Day.\n\n\n\nSource: TikTok/@tiktokhubpages\n\n\nThe Jolly Roger flag of the Straw Hat Pirates from One Piece, a hugely popular Japanese manga and anime series with over 1,100 episodes aired in more than 80 countries, symbolizes the adventurous and rebellious spirit of Monkey D. Luffy and his crew, who stand against a globally oppressive and corrupt government. Interestingly, protesters have adopted this flag as a symbol of collective identity; it represents not only the desire to end corruption but also embodies the Mugiwaras’ promise of freedom and justice. Émile Durkheim believed that symbols, along with shared beliefs and values, create a collective consciousness that holds society together. This illustrates that popular culture does more than entertain us; it shapes our daily lives and provides us with meaningful symbols that can inspire action. Such symbols transcend the fictional realm and become part of real-world struggles.\n\n\n\nCopyright: Claudio Pramana/NurPhoto\n\n\nStories like One Piece play a significant role in shaping the social landscape by helping people envision and embody their hopes for change. The symbols within these narratives serve as rallying cries, representing a form of cultural glocalization that blends global media with local struggles. These stories provide social movements with both a narrative and imagery that they can draw strength from, making the fight for a better Indonesia not just a political issue but also a collective experience of resistance and resilience rooted in global popular culture.\n\n\n\nHow strong is the symbolic significance of One Piece is for the social movement in Indonesia?\nWhen we refer to symbolic value, we are usually talking about the subjective importance that comes from the meanings, associations, and messages expressed within a specific socio-cultural context. However, in today’s information age, we have the tools to evaluate, to some degree, the significance of an object, idea, action, or, in this case, a piece of content within the collective consciousness.\nThe Demand Expressions™ data from Parrot Analytics captures audience attention, engagement, desire, and viewership across all markets, in all languages, and across all platforms and devices. I am using weekly demand data from June 1st to September 13th in a difference-in-differences (DiD) regression model to analyze whether interest in “One Piece” in Indonesia has changed significantly compared to other Southeast and East Asian markets since the start of the Jolly Roger flag protest. I am working under the assumption that if the results show a positive and significant difference, the varying demand for “One Piece” in Indonesia, relative to its average performance in the region, can be attributed to its symbolic significance for the collective identity of the protest.\n\n\nEstimating a DiD regression model in R\nThe first step is to start our R session and load the tidyverse toolkit for our analysis. I recommend using extensions for ggplot2, such as ggalt and ggtext, as they offer greater control over the customization of our visuals. Finally, I utilize stargazer to create well-formatted regression tables for presenting my results.\n\n\nShow the code\nlibrary(tidyverse)  # For data wrangling \nlibrary(ggplot2)    # For nice data visualization\nlibrary(ggalt)      # For nice smooth splines \nlibrary(ggtext)     # For modifying titles and labels text \nlibrary(stargazer)  # For nice regression tables\n\n\nThe next step is to plot the average weekly per-capita demand for “One Piece” over time in Indonesia, East Asia, and Southeast Asia (excluding Indonesia), while also comparing it to the overall regional average. I included East Asia in the analysis for two main reasons. First, to account for variations in the popularity of the show within the Asian market, such as new episode releases or events like One Piece Day. Second, to control for potential spillover effects that the protests in Indonesia may have generated in other Southeast Asian markets, such as Nepal. The graph below illustrates that after the Jolly Roger flag protest began, the demand for the show in Indonesia peaked at 1.88 times higher than the average demand in the region.\n\n\nShow the code\n### Labels and data points for visuals ###\n# Create a tibble with the coordinates of market labels\nlabels = data %&gt;% \n  #

This method involves comparing the average changes over time between a group that experiences the intervention (Indonesia) and a control group that does not (the other Southeast and East Asian markets). The plot below illustrates, with a dashed line, the average demand multiplier for each market before and after the initiation of the Jolly Roger flag protest in Indonesia.\n\n\nShow the code\n### Average Time Series ###\n# Create a variable to differentiate between the before and after\ndata = data %&gt;% \n  mutate(intervention = ifelse(test = date &lt; cutoff, yes = 0, no = 1)) %&gt;% \n  # Get the market average for the before and after\n  with_groups(\n    .groups = c(market, intervention),\n    mutate, \n    average_multiplier = mean(region_multiplier)\n  )\n\n# Create a ggplot canvas\nggplot(\n  # Data to plot\n  data = data, \n  # Data-related aesthetics\n  mapping = aes(x = date, y = region_multiplier, col = market)\n  ) +\n  # Add vertical line\n  geom_vline(\n    # This is the week when the first flag was shown (at least in the news)\n    xintercept = c(cutoff),\n    # Modify the aesthetics\n    linetype = 'dashed', col = 'gray60'\n    ) +\n    # Add point\n  geom_point() +\n  # Add a dashed line with the average multiplier for the Before\n  stat_smooth(\n    data = filter(data, date &lt; cutoff),\n    mapping = aes(x = date, y = average_multiplier, col = market),\n    method = 'lm', linetype = 'dashed', linewidth = 0.75\n  ) +\n   # Add a dashed line with the average multiplier for the After\n  stat_smooth(\n    data = filter(data, date &gt;= cutoff),\n     mapping = aes(x = date, y = average_multiplier, col = market),\n    method = 'lm', linetype = 'dashed', linewidth = 0.75\n  ) +\n  # Add the Before text\n  annotate(\n    geom = 'text',label = 'Before', \n    # Set coordinates\n    x = c(ymd('2025-06-22')), y = 1.95,\n    # Set aesthetics\n    size = 3.5, color = 'gray30', \n    ) +\n  # Add the After text\n  annotate(\n    geom = 'text', label = 'After',\n    # Set coordinates\n    x = c(ymd('2025-08-21')), y = 1.95,\n    # Set aesthetics\n    size = 3.5, color = 'gray30', \n    ) +\n  # Facet by market\n  facet_wrap(~market) +\n  # Add labels\n  labs(\n    title = 'Weekly Demand Performance for One Piece in South and East Asia',\n    subtitle = expression(paste(italic('Before'),' and ', italic('After'),' average demand multiplier (x Times average demand for One Piece in the region)')),\n    caption = 'Source: own elaboration with data from Parrot Analytics\\nAuthor:@renorosgo'\n  ) +\n  # Modify colors\n  scale_color_manual(values = c('green4','red2','blue2')) +\n  # Modify Y axis limits and units\n  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0.5,2), labels = scales::unit_format(suffix = 'x')) +\n  # Set the base theme\n  theme_bw(paper =  'gray99', base_family = 'Avenir Next') +\n  # Additional tweaks to the theme \n  theme(\n    # Remove titles from de axis\n    axis.title = element_blank(),\n    # Delete some grids\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    panel.grid.major.x = element_blank(),\n    # Remove legend (recommended to avoid writting to many `show.legend = F`)\n    legend.position = 'none'\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can observe an increase in the average multiplier value for Indonesia after the protest began.

This table will show the average values prior to the Jolly Roger Flag’s protest, as well as the averages after the protest.\nNext, we will calculate the changes over time for each group by subtracting the pre-protest average from the post-protest average. The key row of the table will highlight the difference between these two changes; this is known as the “difference-in-differences” estimate. This estimate represents the intended impact of the intervention. Essentially, this method isolates the portion of the change in the treated group (Indonesia) that exceeds or falls short of the change observed in the control group (the other Southeast and East Asian markets), providing a clear measure of the intervention’s effect.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJolly Roger flag protest\nBefore\nAfter\nAverage Difference\n\n\n\n\nIndonesia\nA\nB\nB - A\n\n\nControl Market\nC\nD\nD - C\n\n\nAverage Difference\nA - C\nB - D\n(B - A) - (D - C)\n\n\n\nWe can easily fill in the first row for our treated market using dplyr syntax.

We can follow the same steps as in our previous analysis, making just a few modifications to our code to complete the rest of the table. After our intervention, we observed that the change in the demand multiplier for the control group was -0.01. By subtracting the average difference of the control group from the average difference of the treated group, we can determine our DiD estimation. Our calculations show that the average impact of the Jolly Roger Flag protest on the demand performance of One Piece resulted in an increase of approximately 0.16 units in the multiplier compared to the average market in Southeast Asia.\n\n\nShow the code\n# Filter our interest market\ndata_se = data %&gt;% \n  filter(market %in% c('Indonesia','Southeast Asia'))\n\n# C cell\nbefore_control = data_se %&gt;% \n  # Control market before intervention\n  filter(treatment == 0, intervention == 0) %&gt;% \n  # Average multiplier\n  summarise(C = mean(region_multiplier)) %&gt;% \n  # Pull the value\n  pull(C)\n\n# D cell\nafter_control = data_se %&gt;% \n  # Control market after intervention\n  filter(treatment == 0, intervention == 1) %&gt;% \n  # Average multiplier\n  summarise(D = mean(region_multiplier)) %&gt;% \n  # Pull the value\n  pull(D)\n\n# Diff in diff estimator\ndiff_in_diff = (after_treatment - before_treatment) - (after_control - before_control)\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 1: My Caption\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJolly Roger flag protest\nBefore\nAfter\nAverage Difference\n\n\n\n\nIndonesia\n1.554\n1.703\n0.149\n\n\nControl Market\n0.756\n0.743\n-0.013\n\n\nAverage Difference\n0.798\n0.96\n0.162\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf we plot our difference-in-differences calculations alongside our previously calculated average, we can confirm that they align with the average observed values we plotted earlier; in fact, they are the same.\n\n\nShow the code\n### diff in diff graph ###\ndid_df = tibble(\n  # Market name\n  market = c('Indonesia', 'Indonesia','Southeast Asia','Southeast Asia'),\n  # Intervention column\n  intervention = c(0 , 1, 0, 1),\n  # Treatment column\n  treatment = c(1, 1, 0, 0),\n  # Calculated valures\n  values = c(before_treatment, after_treatment, before_control, after_control)\n)\n\n# Create a ggplot canvas\nggplot(data = data_se, mapping = aes(x = intervention, y = region_multiplier)) +\n  # Add points with 1.96 se\n  stat_summary(\n    # Add colour\n    mapping = aes(color = 'Observed'), \n    # Additional aesthetics\n    geom = 'pointrange', fun.data = 'mean_se', fun.args = list(mult = 1.96)\n    ) +\n  # Add our calculated averages\n  geom_point(\n    data = did_df, \n    mapping = aes(x = intervention, y = values, col = 'Calculated'), \n    # Modify aesthetics\n    shape = 13, size = 4\n    ) +\n  # Add labels\n  labs(\n     title = ' Average Weekly Demand Expressions™ for One Piece in Southeast and East Asia',\n    subtitle = expression(paste(italic('Before'),' and ', italic('After'),' average demand multiplier (x Times average demand for One Piece in the region)')),\n    caption = 'Source: own elaboration with data from Parrot Analytics\\nAuthor:@renorosgo',\n    color = \"Mean\"       # Legend title\n  ) +\n  # Split by market\n  facet_wrap(~market) + \n  # Modify scales\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(0,1), labels = c('Before', 'After'), limits = c(-0.25,1.25)) +\n  # Modify Y axis limits and units\n  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0.5,2), labels = scales::unit_format(suffix = 'x')) +\n  # Scale color\n  scale_color_manual(values = c('gray50','red2')) +\n  # Set the base theme\n  theme_bw(paper =  'gray99', base_family = 'Avenir Next') +\n  # Additional tweaks to the theme \n  theme(\n    # Remove titles from de axis\n    axis.title = element_blank(),\n    # Delete some grids\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    panel.grid.major.x = element_blank(),\n    legend.position = 'bottom',\n    legend.title = element_blank()\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4\n\n\n\n\n\nA key requirement for the validity of the difference-in-differences method is the parallel trend assumption. This assumption posits that, in the absence of the intervention, the treated group and the control group would have exhibited similar trends or patterns in their outcomes over time. In simpler terms, had there been no changes related to the protest, the demand performance of One Piece in both markets would likely have followed a similar trajectory.\nThis assumption allows us to attribute any differences in trends observed after the intervention to the effect of the Jolly Roger protest, rather than to other factors or inherent differences between the groups. Essentially, it ensures that the only systematic difference noted after the intervention is due to the treatment itself. This validation supports the causal interpretation of the difference-in-differences estimate. The following plot provides a graphic representation of our parallel trend assumption, illustrated with a blue dashed line. The potential impact of the Jolly Roger flag protest in Indonesia is indicated by a vertical red dashed line.\n\n\nShow the code\n# Create a ggplot canvas\nggplot(\n  data = did_df, \n  mapping = aes(x = intervention, y = values, color = market)\n  ) +\n  # Add our initial values\n  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = intervention, y = values)) +\n  # Add the gray shape\n  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = intervention, y = values), shape = 13, size = 4, col = 'gray40') +\n  # Add the original line\n  geom_line() +\n  # Draw the parallel trend\n  annotate(\n    geom = 'segment',\n    # Set coordinates\n    x = 0, xend = 1, y = before_treatment, yend = after_treatment - diff_in_diff,\n    # Set aesthetics\n    linetype = 'dashed', col = 'blue2', linewidth = 0.75\n  ) +\n  # Add vertical gray projection lines\n  annotate(\n    geom = 'segment',\n    # Set coordinates\n    x = c(0,1), xend = c(0,1), y = before_treatment, yend = before_control,\n    # Set aesthetics\n    linetype = 'dotted', col = 'gray50'\n  ) +\n  # Add the potential effect\n  annotate(\n    geom = 'segment',\n    # Set coordinates\n    x = 1, xend = 1, y = before_treatment, yend = after_treatment,\n    # Set aesthetics\n    linetype = 'dashed', col = 'red2', linewidth = 0.75\n  ) +\n  # Add labels\n  labs(\n     title = 'Difference in differences parrallel trend assumption',\n    subtitle = expression(paste(italic('Before'),' and ', italic('After'),' average demand multiplier (x Times average demand for One Piece in the region)')),\n    caption = 'Source: own elaboration with data from Parrot Analytics\\nAuthor:@renorosgo',\n    color = \"Mean\"  \n  ) +\n  # Modify X axis limits and labels\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(0,1), labels = c('Before', 'After'), limits = c(-0.25,1.25)) +\n  # Modify Y axis limits and units\n  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0.5,1.8), labels = scales::unit_format(suffix = 'x')) +\n  # Set colors\n  scale_color_manual(values = c('red2','blue2')) +\n  # Set the base theme\n  theme_bw(paper =  'gray99', base_family = 'Avenir Next') +\n  # Additional tweaks to the theme \n  theme(\n    # Remove titles from de axis\n    axis.title = element_blank(),\n    # Delete some grids\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    panel.grid.major.x = element_blank(),\n    # Remove legend (recommended to avoid writting to many `show.legend = F`)\n    legend.position = 'none'\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5\n\n\n\n\n\nWe want to determine whether the Difference-in-Differences (DiD) estimate of 0.16 is statistically significant. In other words, we aim to confirm that this estimate is genuinely different from zero and not merely a result of random variation.\nLinear regression is an effective method for simultaneously analyzing the combined effects of multiple factors. When applied to a DiD analysis, it considers important information, such as whether a market received the intervention, whether the time period is before or after the intervention, and crucially, whether the market was treated after the change.\nThe fundamental idea is straightforward: we want to mathematically describe our red and blue dashed lines in Figure 2 using the following equation:\n\\[Demand Multiplier = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1intervention + \\beta_2treatment + \\beta_3DiD+\\epsilon\\]\nThe following table displays the results of our linear regression, which uses the average performance of Southeast Asian markets as a control. Notably, the estimates for each variable correspond with those from Table 1. This correlation occurs because linear regression uses matrix operations to estimate the coefficients, ( _i ), centered around the mean.\nThe advantage of conducting this statistical analysis is that it allows us to assess the statistical significance of our findings. As we can observe, the estimate of -0.01 for the intervention variable, which we calculated earlier, is not statistically significant. This means it is not significantly different from zero, indicating that our control market did not experience any change in average performance following the onset of the Jolly Roger flag protest.\nIn contrast, estimates that are statistically significant are considered different from zero. Specifically, our Difference-in-Differences (DiD) estimator indicates an increase of 0.16 units in the multiplier when compared to the control group, which can be attributed to the Jolly Roger flag protest associated with One Piece.\n\n\nShow the code\nmodel_1 = lm(\n  # This is how we input the formula for the regresion model\n  formula = region_multiplier ~ intervention + treatment + `DiD`,\n  # We are using our previously filtered data\n  data = data_se\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDependent variable:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDemand Multiplier\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nintervention\n\n\n-0.013\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(0.038)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntreatment\n\n\n0.798***\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(0.039)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiD\n\n\n0.162***\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(0.053)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConstant\n\n\n0.756***\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(0.028)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObservations\n\n\n30\n\n\n\n\nR2\n\n\n0.977\n\n\n\n\nAdjusted R2\n\n\n0.975\n\n\n\n\nResidual Std.

This DiD term indicates how much of the change in demand can be directly attributed to the intervention, helping to isolate its impact from other influencing factors and providing a clearer understanding of its true effects.\nTo strengthen the validity of the Southeast Asia model, we will estimate a new DiD regression using the average market data from East Asia as our control group. This approach allows us to account for variations in the show’s popularity within the Asian market, such as the release of new episodes or other relevant events. It also helps prevent underestimating the effects due to the influence Indonesia may have had on other Southeast Asian markets, such as Nepal.\nConsistent with the previous model, the East Asia model shows a significant increase of 0.16 units in the multiplier compared to the average East Asian market. Additionally, we do not observe any significant impact from the Jolly Roger flag protest in the control market.\n\n\nShow the code\nmodel_2 = data %&gt;% \n  # Filter to remove the Southeast market\n  filter(market != 'Southeast Asia') %&gt;% \n  # Run the regresion\n  lm(formula = region_multiplier ~ intervention + treatment + `DiD`)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDependent variable:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDemand Multiplier\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSoutheast Asia\n\n\nEast Asia\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(1)\n\n\n(2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nintervention\n\n\n-0.013\n\n\n-0.014\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(0.038)\n\n\n(0.040)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntreatment\n\n\n0.798***\n\n\n0.372***\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(0.039)\n\n\n(0.041)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiD\n\n\n0.162***\n\n\n0.163***\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(0.053)\n\n\n(0.056)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConstant\n\n\n0.756***\n\n\n1.182***\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(0.028)\n\n\n(0.029)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObservations\n\n\n30\n\n\n30\n\n\n\n\nR2\n\n\n0.977\n\n\n0.915\n\n\n\n\nAdjusted R2\n\n\n0.975\n\n\n0.905\n\n\n\n\nResidual Std.

Statistical methods like difference-in-differences support this connection, reminding us that symbols like One Piece embody collective hopes and desires, serving as cultural anchors during times of social upheaval.\nHow significant is One Piece for the Jolly Roger protests in Indonesia? Our analysis reveals that interest in the series surged by nearly 9.5% in response to the protests. Given that the manga has sold over 516 million copies and the anime has amassed millions of viewing hours on platforms like Netflix, this increase underscores how popular culture can unite communities in their shared aspirations for change and justice. Ultimately, this case illustrates that entertainment and storytelling are not merely forms of escapism; they are vital forces that shape social identities and inspire collective action. As societies continue to evolve, embracing these cultural dynamics becomes essential for engaging with and interpreting contemporary social movements.\n\n\nShow the code\ndata %&gt;% \n  filter(market == 'Indonesia') %&gt;% \n  # Create a ggplot canvas\n  ggplot(\n  # Data-related aesthetics\n  mapping = aes(x = date, y = region_multiplier, col = market)\n  ) +\n  # Add vertical line\n  geom_vline(\n    # This is the week when the first flag was shown (at leas in the news)\n    xintercept = c(cutoff),\n    # Modify the aesthetics\n    linetype = 'dashed', col = 'gray60'\n    ) +\n  # Add point\n  geom_point(size = 1, alpha = 0.25) +\n  # Add a dashed line with the average multiplier for the Before\n  geom_xspline(\n    data = filter(data, date &lt; cutoff, market == 'Indonesia') %&gt;% \n      mutate(date = ifelse(date == max(date), cutoff, date)),\n    mapping = aes(x = date, y = region_multiplier, col = market),\n    linewidth = 0.5, alpha = 0.25\n  ) +\n  # Add a dashed line with the average multiplier for the After\n  geom_xspline(\n    data = filter(data, date &gt;= cutoff, market == 'Indonesia'),\n    mapping = aes(x = date, y = region_multiplier, col = market), \n    spline_shape = -0.5, alpha = 0.25\n  ) +\n  # Add a dashed line with the average multiplier for the Before\n  stat_smooth(\n    data = filter(data, date &lt; cutoff, market == 'Indonesia')%&gt;% \n      mutate(date = ifelse(date == max(date), cutoff, date)),\n    mapping = aes(x = date, y = average_multiplier),\n    method = 'lm', linetype = 'dashed', linewidth = 0.75, col = 'red2'\n  ) +\n  # Add a dashed line with the average multiplier for the After\n  stat_smooth(\n    data = filter(data, date &gt;= cutoff, market == 'Indonesia') ,\n    mapping = aes(x = date, y = average_multiplier),\n    method = 'lm', linetype = 'dashed', linewidth = 0.75, col = 'red2'\n  ) +\n  annotate(\n  geom = 'segment',\n    x = cutoff, xend = cutoff,\n    y = before_treatment, yend = after_treatment,\n    col = 'red2', linewidth = 1\n  ) +\n  annotate(\n    geom = 'point',\n    x = cutoff, y = c(before_treatment, after_treatment), \n    shape = 18, size = 4, col = 'red2'\n  ) +\n  # Annotate the relevant text\n  annotate(\n    # Use GeomRichtext as geom\n    geom = ggtext::GeomRichtext,\n    # Set coordinates\n    x = cutoff - 1, y = after_treatment,\n    # Html and linked to data format\n    label = sprintf(\n        fmt = \n          \"A &lt;span style='color:black'&gt;**%s%% increase** in One Piece performance&lt;br&gt;can be attributed to the Jolly Roger flag protest&lt;/span&gt;\",\n        round(x = 100 * diff_in_diff/after_treatment, digits = 2)\n    ),\n    # Set aesthetics\n    size = 2.5, hjust = 1, vjust = 0.5, color = 'red2', \n  ) +\n  # Add labels\n  labs(\n    title = 'Weekly Demand for One Piece in Indonesia',\n    subtitle = 'Overall Southeast and East Asia demand multiplier (x Times average demand for One Piece)',\n    caption = 'Source: own elaboration with data from Parrot Analytics\\nAuthor:@renorosgo'\n  ) +\n  # Modify colors\n  scale_color_manual(values = c('red2')) +\n  # Modify Y axis limits and units\n  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(1.45,1.85), labels = scales::unit_format(suffix = 'x')) +\n  scale_x_date(date_labels = \"%d-%b-%y\", date_breaks = \"2 weeks\") +\n  # Set the base theme\n  theme_bw(paper =  'gray99', base_family = 'Avenir Next') +\n  # Additional tweaks to the theme \n  theme(\n    # Remove titles from de axis\n    axis.title = element_blank(),\n    # Delete some grids\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    panel.grid.major.x = element_blank(),\n    # Remove legend (recommended to avoid writting to many `show.legend = F`)\n    legend.position = 'none'\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6"

    "text": "Popular culture has evolved beyond mere entertainment; it has become a significant medium for self-expression and social connection. In Indonesia, a surprising symbol of rebellion, adventure, and resistance against oppression has emerged among protesters. But how strong is the symbolic significance of this emblem? In this post, we will explore how data from the entertainment industry can illuminate the role of One Piece in Indonesia’s protests. By employing causal inference methods and data from Parrot Analytics, we aim to determine whether the popularity of this fictional world reflects real-life actions and what this reveals about the relationship between pop culture and social change.\n\nQuick context on Indonesia and the recent protest.\nRecently, Indonesia has seen a wave of protests fueled by economic and political frustrations, along with rising uncertainty about the future. Since late July, truck drivers in the country have started waving the Jolly Roger flag as a way to protest new transport regulations. What began as a viral trend on social media quickly turned into a collective movement, with demonstrators nationwide raising the flag to symbolize their discontent during Indonesia’s 80th National Day.\n\n\n\nSource: TikTok/@tiktokhubpages\n\n\nThe Jolly Roger flag of the Straw Hat Pirates from One Piece, a hugely popular Japanese manga and anime series with over 1,100 episodes aired in more than 80 countries, symbolizes the adventurous and rebellious spirit of Monkey D. Luffy and his crew, who stand against a globally oppressive and corrupt government. Interestingly, protesters have adopted this flag as a symbol of collective identity; it represents not only the desire to end corruption but also embodies the Mugiwaras’ promise of freedom and justice. Émile Durkheim believed that symbols, along with shared beliefs and values, create a collective consciousness that holds society together. This illustrates that popular culture does more than entertain us; it shapes our daily lives and provides us with meaningful symbols that can inspire action. Such symbols transcend the fictional realm and become part of real-world struggles.\n\n\n\nCopyright: Claudio Pramana/NurPhoto\n\n\nStories like One Piece play a significant role in shaping the social landscape by helping people envision and embody their hopes for change. The symbols within these narratives serve as rallying cries, representing a form of cultural glocalization that blends global media with local struggles. These stories provide social movements with both a narrative and imagery that they can draw strength from, making the fight for a better Indonesia not just a political issue but also a collective experience of resistance and resilience rooted in global popular culture.\n\n\n\nHow strong is the symbolic significance of One Piece is for the social movement in Indonesia?\nWhen we refer to symbolic value, we are usually talking about the subjective importance that comes from the meanings, associations, and messages expressed within a specific socio-cultural context. However, in today’s information age, we have the tools to evaluate, to some degree, the significance of an object, idea, action, or, in this case, a piece of content within the collective consciousness.\nThe Demand Expressions™ data from Parrot Analytics captures audience attention, engagement, desire, and viewership across all markets, in all languages, and across all platforms and devices. I am using weekly demand data from June 1st to September 13th in a difference-in-differences (DiD) regression model to analyze whether interest in “One Piece” in Indonesia has changed significantly compared to other Southeast and East Asian markets since the start of the Jolly Roger flag protest. I am working under the assumption that if the results show a positive and significant difference, the varying demand for “One Piece” in Indonesia, relative to its average performance in the region, can be attributed to its symbolic significance for the collective identity of the protest.\n\n\nEstimating a DiD regression model in R\nThe first step is to start our R session and load the tidyverse toolkit for our analysis. I recommend using extensions for ggplot2, such as ggalt and ggtext, as they offer greater control over the customization of our visuals. Finally, I utilize stargazer to create well-formatted regression tables for presenting my results.\n\n\nShow the code\nlibrary(tidyverse)  # For data wrangling \nlibrary(ggplot2)    # For nice data visualization\nlibrary(ggalt)      # For nice smooth splines \nlibrary(ggtext)     # For modifying titles and labels text \nlibrary(stargazer)  # For nice regression tables\n\n\nThe next step is to plot the average weekly per-capita demand for “One Piece” over time in Indonesia, East Asia, and Southeast Asia (excluding Indonesia), while also comparing it to the overall regional average. I included East Asia in the analysis for two main reasons. First, to account for variations in the popularity of the show within the Asian market, such as new episode releases or events like One Piece Day. Second, to control for potential spillover effects that the protests in Indonesia may have generated in other Southeast Asian markets, such as Nepal. The graph below illustrates that after the Jolly Roger flag protest began, the demand for the show in Indonesia peaked at 1.88 times higher than the average demand in the region.\n\n\nShow the code\n### Labels and data points for visuals ###\n# Create a tibble with the coordinates of market labels\nlabels = data %&gt;% \n  #

This table will show the average values prior to the Jolly Roger Flag’s protest, as well as the averages after the protest.\nNext, we will calculate the changes over time for each group by subtracting the pre-protest average from the post-protest average. The key row of the table will highlight the difference between these two changes; this is known as the “difference-in-differences” estimate. This estimate represents the intended impact of the intervention. Essentially, this method isolates the portion of the change in the treated group (Indonesia) that exceeds or falls short of the change observed in the control group (the other Southeast and East Asian markets), providing a clear measure of the intervention’s effect.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJolly Roger flag protest\nBefore\nAfter\nAverage Difference\n\n\n\n\nIndonesia\nA\nB\nB - A\n\n\nControl Market\nC\nD\nD - C\n\n\nAverage Difference\nA - C\nB - D\n(B - A) - (D - C)\n\n\n\nWe can easily fill in the first row for our treated market using dplyr syntax.

We can follow the same steps as in our previous analysis, making just a few modifications to our code to complete the rest of the table. After our intervention, we observed that the change in the demand multiplier for the control group was -0.01. By subtracting the average difference of the control group from the average difference of the treated group, we can determine our DiD estimation. Our calculations show that the average impact of the Jolly Roger Flag protest on the demand performance of One Piece resulted in an increase of approximately 0.16 units in the multiplier compared to the average market in Southeast Asia.\n\n\nShow the code\n# Filter our interest market\ndata_se = data %&gt;% \n  filter(market %in% c('Indonesia','Southeast Asia'))\n\n# C cell\nbefore_control = data_se %&gt;% \n  # Control market before intervention\n  filter(treatment == 0, intervention == 0) %&gt;% \n  # Average multiplier\n  summarise(C = mean(region_multiplier)) %&gt;% \n  # Pull the value\n  pull(C)\n\n# D cell\nafter_control = data_se %&gt;% \n  # Control market after intervention\n  filter(treatment == 0, intervention == 1) %&gt;% \n  # Average multiplier\n  summarise(D = mean(region_multiplier)) %&gt;% \n  # Pull the value\n  pull(D)\n\n# Diff in diff estimator\ndiff_in_diff = (after_treatment - before_treatment) - (after_control - before_control)\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 1: My Caption\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJolly Roger flag protest\nBefore\nAfter\nAverage Difference\n\n\n\n\nIndonesia\n1.554\n1.703\n0.149\n\n\nControl Market\n0.756\n0.743\n-0.013\n\n\nAverage Difference\n0.798\n0.96\n0.162\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf we plot our difference-in-differences calculations alongside our previously calculated average, we can confirm that they align with the average observed values we plotted earlier; in fact, they are the same.\n\n\nShow the code\n### diff in diff graph ###\ndid_df = tibble(\n  # Market name\n  market = c('Indonesia', 'Indonesia','Southeast Asia','Southeast Asia'),\n  # Intervention column\n  intervention = c(0 , 1, 0, 1),\n  # Treatment column\n  treatment = c(1, 1, 0, 0),\n  # Calculated valures\n  values = c(before_treatment, after_treatment, before_control, after_control)\n)\n\n# Create a ggplot canvas\nggplot(data = data_se, mapping = aes(x = intervention, y = region_multiplier)) +\n  # Add points with 1.96 se\n  stat_summary(\n    # Add colour\n    mapping = aes(color = 'Observed'), \n    # Additional aesthetics\n    geom = 'pointrange', fun.data = 'mean_se', fun.args = list(mult = 1.96)\n    ) +\n  # Add our calculated averages\n  geom_point(\n    data = did_df, \n    mapping = aes(x = intervention, y = values, col = 'Calculated'), \n    # Modify aesthetics\n    shape = 13, size = 4\n    ) +\n  # Add labels\n  labs(\n     title = ' Average Weekly Demand Expressions™ for One Piece in Southeast and East Asia',\n    subtitle = expression(paste(italic('Before'),' and ', italic('After'),' average demand multiplier (x Times average demand for One Piece in the region)')),\n    caption = 'Source: own elaboration with data from Parrot Analytics\\nAuthor:@renorosgo',\n    color = \"Mean\"       # Legend title\n  ) +\n  # Split by market\n  facet_wrap(~market) + \n  # Modify scales\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(0,1), labels = c('Before', 'After'), limits = c(-0.25,1.25)) +\n  # Modify Y axis limits and units\n  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0.5,2), labels = scales::unit_format(suffix = 'x')) +\n  # Scale color\n  scale_color_manual(values = c('gray50','red2')) +\n  # Set the base theme\n  theme_bw(paper =  'gray99', base_family = 'Avenir Next') +\n  # Additional tweaks to the theme \n  theme(\n    # Remove titles from de axis\n    axis.title = element_blank(),\n    # Delete some grids\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    panel.grid.major.x = element_blank(),\n    legend.position = 'bottom',\n    legend.title = element_blank()\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4\n\n\n\n\n\nA key requirement for the validity of the difference-in-differences method is the parallel trend assumption. This assumption posits that, in the absence of the intervention, the treated group and the control group would have exhibited similar trends or patterns in their outcomes over time. In simpler terms, had there been no changes related to the protest, the demand performance of One Piece in both markets would likely have followed a similar trajectory.\nThis assumption allows us to attribute any differences in trends observed after the intervention to the effect of the Jolly Roger protest, rather than to other factors or inherent differences between the groups. Essentially, it ensures that the only systematic difference noted after the intervention is due to the treatment itself. This validation supports the causal interpretation of the difference-in-differences estimate. The following plot provides a graphic representation of our parallel trend assumption, illustrated with a blue dashed line. The potential impact of the Jolly Roger flag protest in Indonesia is indicated by a vertical red dashed line.\n\n\nShow the code\n# Create a ggplot canvas\nggplot(\n  data = did_df, \n  mapping = aes(x = intervention, y = values, color = market)\n  ) +\n  # Add our initial values\n  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = intervention, y = values)) +\n  # Add the gray shape\n  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = intervention, y = values), shape = 13, size = 4, col = 'gray40') +\n  # Add the original line\n  geom_line() +\n  # Draw the parallel trend\n  annotate(\n    geom = 'segment',\n    # Set coordinates\n    x = 0, xend = 1, y = before_treatment, yend = after_treatment - diff_in_diff,\n    # Set aesthetics\n    linetype = 'dashed', col = 'blue2', linewidth = 0.75\n  ) +\n  # Add vertical gray projection lines\n  annotate(\n    geom = 'segment',\n    # Set coordinates\n    x = c(0,1), xend = c(0,1), y = before_treatment, yend = before_control,\n    # Set aesthetics\n    linetype = 'dotted', col = 'gray50'\n  ) +\n  # Add the potential effect\n  annotate(\n    geom = 'segment',\n    # Set coordinates\n    x = 1, xend = 1, y = before_treatment, yend = after_treatment,\n    # Set aesthetics\n    linetype = 'dashed', col = 'red2', linewidth = 0.75\n  ) +\n  # Add labels\n  labs(\n     title = 'Difference in differences parrallel trend assumption',\n    subtitle = expression(paste(italic('Before'),' and ', italic('After'),' average demand multiplier (x Times average demand for One Piece in the region)')),\n    caption = 'Source: own elaboration with data from Parrot Analytics\\nAuthor:@renorosgo',\n    color = \"Mean\"  \n  ) +\n  # Modify X axis limits and labels\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(0,1), labels = c('Before', 'After'), limits = c(-0.25,1.25)) +\n  # Modify Y axis limits and units\n  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0.5,1.8), labels = scales::unit_format(suffix = 'x')) +\n  # Set colors\n  scale_color_manual(values = c('red2','blue2')) +\n  # Set the base theme\n  theme_bw(paper =  'gray99', base_family = 'Avenir Next') +\n  # Additional tweaks to the theme \n  theme(\n    # Remove titles from de axis\n    axis.title = element_blank(),\n    # Delete some grids\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    panel.grid.major.x = element_blank(),\n    # Remove legend (recommended to avoid writting to many `show.legend = F`)\n    legend.position = 'none'\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5\n\n\n\n\n\nWe want to determine whether the Difference-in-Differences (DiD) estimate of 0.16 is statistically significant. In other words, we aim to confirm that this estimate is genuinely different from zero and not merely a result of random variation.\nLinear regression is an effective method for simultaneously analyzing the combined effects of multiple factors. When applied to a DiD analysis, it considers important information, such as whether a market received the intervention, whether the time period is before or after the intervention, and crucially, whether the market was treated after the change.\nThe fundamental idea is straightforward: we want to mathematically describe our red and blue dashed lines in Figure 2 using the following equation:\n\\[Demand Multiplier = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1intervention + \\beta_2treatment + \\beta_3DiD+\\epsilon\\]\nThe following table displays the results of our linear regression, which uses the average performance of Southeast Asian markets as a control. Notably, the estimates for each variable correspond with those from Table 1. This correlation occurs because linear regression uses matrix operations to estimate the coefficients, ( _i ), centered around the mean.\nThe advantage of conducting this statistical analysis is that it allows us to assess the statistical significance of our findings. As we can observe, the estimate of -0.01 for the intervention variable, which we calculated earlier, is not statistically significant. This means it is not significantly different from zero, indicating that our control market did not experience any change in average performance following the onset of the Jolly Roger flag protest.\nIn contrast, estimates that are statistically significant are considered different from zero. Specifically, our Difference-in-Differences (DiD) estimator indicates an increase of 0.16 units in the multiplier when compared to the control group, which can be attributed to the Jolly Roger flag protest associated with One Piece.\n\n\nShow the code\nmodel_1 = lm(\n  # This is how we input the formula for the regresion model\n  formula = region_multiplier ~ intervention + treatment + `DiD`,\n  # We are using our previously filtered data\n  data = data_se\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDependent variable:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDemand Multiplier\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nintervention\n\n\n-0.013\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(0.038)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntreatment\n\n\n0.798***\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(0.039)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiD\n\n\n0.162***\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(0.053)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConstant\n\n\n0.756***\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(0.028)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObservations\n\n\n30\n\n\n\n\nR2\n\n\n0.977\n\n\n\n\nAdjusted R2\n\n\n0.975\n\n\n\n\nResidual Std.

This DiD term indicates how much of the change in demand can be directly attributed to the intervention, helping to isolate its impact from other influencing factors and providing a clearer understanding of its true effects.\nTo strengthen the validity of the Southeast Asia model, we will estimate a new DiD regression using the average market data from East Asia as our control group. This approach allows us to account for variations in the show’s popularity within the Asian market, such as the release of new episodes or other relevant events. It also helps prevent underestimating the effects due to the influence Indonesia may have had on other Southeast Asian markets, such as Nepal.\nConsistent with the previous model, the East Asia model shows a significant increase of 0.16 units in the multiplier compared to the average East Asian market. Additionally, we do not observe any significant impact from the Jolly Roger flag protest in the control market.\n\n\nShow the code\nmodel_2 = data %&gt;% \n  # Filter to remove the Southeast market\n  filter(market != 'Southeast Asia') %&gt;% \n  # Run the regresion\n  lm(formula = region_multiplier ~ intervention + treatment + `DiD`)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDependent variable:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDemand Multiplier\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSoutheast Asia\n\n\nEast Asia\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(1)\n\n\n(2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nintervention\n\n\n-0.013\n\n\n-0.014\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(0.038)\n\n\n(0.040)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntreatment\n\n\n0.798***\n\n\n0.372***\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(0.039)\n\n\n(0.041)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiD\n\n\n0.162***\n\n\n0.163***\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(0.053)\n\n\n(0.056)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConstant\n\n\n0.756***\n\n\n1.182***\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(0.028)\n\n\n(0.029)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObservations\n\n\n30\n\n\n30\n\n\n\n\nR2\n\n\n0.977\n\n\n0.915\n\n\n\n\nAdjusted R2\n\n\n0.975\n\n\n0.905\n\n\n\n\nResidual Std.

Statistical methods like difference-in-differences support this connection, reminding us that symbols like One Piece embody collective hopes and desires, serving as cultural anchors during times of social upheaval.\nHow significant is One Piece for the Jolly Roger protests in Indonesia? Our analysis reveals that interest in the series surged by nearly 9.5% in response to the protests. Given that the manga has sold over 516 million copies and the anime has amassed millions of viewing hours on platforms like Netflix, this increase underscores how popular culture can unite communities in their shared aspirations for change and justice. Ultimately, this case illustrates that entertainment and storytelling are not merely forms of escapism; they are vital forces that shape social identities and inspire collective action. As societies continue to evolve, embracing these cultural dynamics becomes essential for engaging with and interpreting contemporary social movements.\n\n\nShow the code\ndata %&gt;% \n  filter(market == 'Indonesia') %&gt;% \n  # Create a ggplot canvas\n  ggplot(\n  # Data-related aesthetics\n  mapping = aes(x = date, y = region_multiplier, col = market)\n  ) +\n  # Add vertical line\n  geom_vline(\n    # This is the week when the first flag was shown (at leas in the news)\n    xintercept = c(cutoff),\n    # Modify the aesthetics\n    linetype = 'dashed', col = 'gray60'\n    ) +\n  # Add point\n  geom_point(size = 1, alpha = 0.25) +\n  # Add a dashed line with the average multiplier for the Before\n  geom_xspline(\n    data = filter(data, date &lt; cutoff, market == 'Indonesia') %&gt;% \n      mutate(date = ifelse(date == max(date), cutoff, date)),\n    mapping = aes(x = date, y = region_multiplier, col = market),\n    linewidth = 0.5, alpha = 0.25\n  ) +\n  # Add a dashed line with the average multiplier for the After\n  geom_xspline(\n    data = filter(data, date &gt;= cutoff, market == 'Indonesia'),\n    mapping = aes(x = date, y = region_multiplier, col = market), \n    spline_shape = -0.5, alpha = 0.25\n  ) +\n  # Add a dashed line with the average multiplier for the Before\n  stat_smooth(\n    data = filter(data, date &lt; cutoff, market == 'Indonesia')%&gt;% \n      mutate(date = ifelse(date == max(date), cutoff, date)),\n    mapping = aes(x = date, y = average_multiplier),\n    method = 'lm', linetype = 'dashed', linewidth = 0.75, col = 'red2'\n  ) +\n  # Add a dashed line with the average multiplier for the After\n  stat_smooth(\n    data = filter(data, date &gt;= cutoff, market == 'Indonesia') ,\n    mapping = aes(x = date, y = average_multiplier),\n    method = 'lm', linetype = 'dashed', linewidth = 0.75, col = 'red2'\n  ) +\n  annotate(\n  geom = 'segment',\n    x = cutoff, xend = cutoff,\n    y = before_treatment, yend = after_treatment,\n    col = 'red2', linewidth = 1\n  ) +\n  annotate(\n    geom = 'point',\n    x = cutoff, y = c(before_treatment, after_treatment), \n    shape = 18, size = 4, col = 'red2'\n  ) +\n  # Annotate the relevant text\n  annotate(\n    # Use GeomRichtext as geom\n    geom = ggtext::GeomRichtext,\n    # Set coordinates\n    x = cutoff - 1, y = after_treatment,\n    # Html and linked to data format\n    label = sprintf(\n        fmt = \n          \"A &lt;span style='color:black'&gt;**%s%% increase** in One Piece performance&lt;br&gt;can be attributed to the Jolly Roger flag protest&lt;/span&gt;\",\n        round(x = 100 * diff_in_diff/after_treatment, digits = 2)\n    ),\n    # Set aesthetics\n    size = 2.5, hjust = 1, vjust = 0.5, color = 'red2', \n  ) +\n  # Add labels\n  labs(\n    title = 'Weekly Demand for One Piece in Indonesia',\n    subtitle = 'Overall Southeast and East Asia demand multiplier (x Times average demand for One Piece)',\n    caption = 'Source: own elaboration with data from Parrot Analytics\\nAuthor:@renorosgo'\n  ) +\n  # Modify colors\n  scale_color_manual(values = c('red2')) +\n  # Modify Y axis limits and units\n  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(1.45,1.85), labels = scales::unit_format(suffix = 'x')) +\n  scale_x_date(date_labels = \"%d-%b-%y\", date_breaks = \"2 weeks\") +\n  # Set the base theme\n  theme_bw(paper =  'gray99', base_family = 'Avenir Next') +\n  # Additional tweaks to the theme \n  theme(\n    # Remove titles from de axis\n    axis.title = element_blank(),\n    # Delete some grids\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    panel.grid.major.x = element_blank(),\n    # Remove legend (recommended to avoid writting to many `show.legend = F`)\n    legend.position = 'none'\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6"

    "section": "",
    "text": "Popular culture has evolved beyond mere entertainment; it has become a significant medium for self-expression and social connection. In Indonesia, a surprising symbol of rebellion, adventure, and resistance against oppression has emerged among protesters. But how strong is the symbolic significance of this emblem? In this post, we will explore how data from the entertainment industry can illuminate the role of One Piece in Indonesia’s protests. By employing causal inference methods and data from Parrot Analytics, we aim to determine whether the popularity of this fictional world reflects real-life actions and what this reveals about the relationship between pop culture and social change.\n\nQuick context on Indonesia and the recent protest.\nRecently, Indonesia has seen a wave of protests fueled by economic and political frustrations, along with rising uncertainty about the future. Since late July, truck drivers in the country have started waving the Jolly Roger flag as a way to protest new transport regulations. What began as a viral trend on social media quickly turned into a collective movement, with demonstrators nationwide raising the flag to symbolize their discontent during Indonesia’s 80th National Day.\n\n\n\nSource: TikTok/@tiktokhubpages\n\n\nThe Jolly Roger flag of the Straw Hat Pirates from One Piece, a hugely popular Japanese manga and anime series with over 1,100 episodes aired in more than 80 countries, symbolizes the adventurous and rebellious spirit of Monkey D. Luffy and his crew, who stand against a globally oppressive and corrupt government. Interestingly, protesters have adopted this flag as a symbol of collective identity; it represents not only the desire to end corruption but also embodies the Mugiwaras’ promise of freedom and justice. Émile Durkheim believed that symbols, along with shared beliefs and values, create a collective consciousness that holds society together. This illustrates that popular culture does more than entertain us; it shapes our daily lives and provides us with meaningful symbols that can inspire action. Such symbols transcend the fictional realm and become part of real-world struggles.\n\n\n\nCopyright: Claudio Pramana/NurPhoto\n\n\nStories like One Piece play a significant role in shaping the social landscape by helping people envision and embody their hopes for change. The symbols within these narratives serve as rallying cries, representing a form of cultural glocalization that blends global media with local struggles. These stories provide social movements with both a narrative and imagery that they can draw strength from, making the fight for a better Indonesia not just a political issue but also a collective experience of resistance and resilience rooted in global popular culture.\n\n\n\nHow strong is the symbolic significance of One Piece is for the social movement in Indonesia?\nWhen we refer to symbolic value, we are usually talking about the subjective importance that comes from the meanings, associations, and messages expressed within a specific socio-cultural context. However, in today’s information age, we have the tools to evaluate, to some degree, the significance of an object, idea, action, or, in this case, a piece of content within the collective consciousness.\nThe Demand Expressions™ data from Parrot Analytics captures audience attention, engagement, desire, and viewership across all markets, in all languages, and across all platforms and devices. I am using weekly demand data from June 1st to September 13th in a difference-in-differences (DiD) regression model to analyze whether interest in “One Piece” in Indonesia has changed significantly compared to other Southeast and East Asian markets since the start of the Jolly Roger flag protest. I am working under the assumption that if the results show a positive and significant difference, the varying demand for “One Piece” in Indonesia, relative to its average performance in the region, can be attributed to its symbolic significance for the collective identity of the protest.\n\n\nEstimating a DiD regression model in R\nThe first step is to start our R session and load the tidyverse toolkit for our analysis. I recommend using extensions for ggplot2, such as ggalt and ggtext, as they offer greater control over the customization of our visuals. Finally, I utilize stargazer to create well-formatted regression tables for presenting my results.\n\n\nShow the code\nlibrary(tidyverse)  # For data wrangling \nlibrary(ggplot2)    # For nice data visualization\nlibrary(ggalt)      # For nice smooth splines \nlibrary(ggtext)     # For modifying titles and labels text \nlibrary(stargazer)  # For nice regression tables\n\n\nThe next step is to plot the average weekly per-capita demand for “One Piece” over time in Indonesia, East Asia, and Southeast Asia (excluding Indonesia), while also comparing it to the overall regional average. I included East Asia in the analysis for two main reasons. First, to account for variations in the popularity of the show within the Asian market, such as new episode releases or events like One Piece Day. Second, to control for potential spillover effects that the protests in Indonesia may have generated in other Southeast Asian markets, such as Nepal. The graph below illustrates that after the Jolly Roger flag protest began, the demand for the show in Indonesia peaked at 1.88 times higher than the average demand in the region.\n\n\nShow the code\n### Labels and data points for visuals ###\n# Create a tibble with the coordinates of market labels\nlabels = data %&gt;% \n  #

This method involves comparing the average changes over time between a group that experiences the intervention (Indonesia) and a control group that does not (the other Southeast and East Asian markets). The plot below illustrates, with a dashed line, the average demand multiplier for each market before and after the initiation of the Jolly Roger flag protest in Indonesia.\n\n\nShow the code\n### Average Time Series ###\n# Create a variable to differentiate between the before and after\ndata = data %&gt;% \n  mutate(intervention = ifelse(test = date &lt; cutoff, yes = 0, no = 1)) %&gt;% \n  # Get the market average for the before and after\n  with_groups(\n    .groups = c(market, intervention),\n    mutate, \n    average_multiplier = mean(region_multiplier)\n  )\n\n# Create a ggplot canvas\nggplot(\n  # Data to plot\n  data = data, \n  # Data-related aesthetics\n  mapping = aes(x = date, y = region_multiplier, col = market)\n  ) +\n  # Add vertical line\n  geom_vline(\n    # This is the week when the first flag was shown (at least in the news)\n    xintercept = c(cutoff),\n    # Modify the aesthetics\n    linetype = 'dashed', col = 'gray60'\n    ) +\n    # Add point\n  geom_point() +\n  # Add a dashed line with the average multiplier for the Before\n  stat_smooth(\n    data = filter(data, date &lt; cutoff),\n    mapping = aes(x = date, y = average_multiplier, col = market),\n    method = 'lm', linetype = 'dashed', linewidth = 0.75\n  ) +\n   # Add a dashed line with the average multiplier for the After\n  stat_smooth(\n    data = filter(data, date &gt;= cutoff),\n     mapping = aes(x = date, y = average_multiplier, col = market),\n    method = 'lm', linetype = 'dashed', linewidth = 0.75\n  ) +\n  # Add the Before text\n  annotate(\n    geom = 'text',label = 'Before', \n    # Set coordinates\n    x = c(ymd('2025-06-22')), y = 1.95,\n    # Set aesthetics\n    size = 3.5, color = 'gray30', \n    ) +\n  # Add the After text\n  annotate(\n    geom = 'text', label = 'After',\n    # Set coordinates\n    x = c(ymd('2025-08-21')), y = 1.95,\n    # Set aesthetics\n    size = 3.5, color = 'gray30', \n    ) +\n  # Facet by market\n  facet_wrap(~market) +\n  # Add labels\n  labs(\n    title = 'Weekly Demand Performance for One Piece in South and East Asia',\n    subtitle = expression(paste(italic('Before'),' and ', italic('After'),' average demand multiplier (x Times average demand for One Piece in the region)')),\n    caption = 'Source: own elaboration with data from Parrot Analytics\\nAuthor:@renorosgo'\n  ) +\n  # Modify colors\n  scale_color_manual(values = c('green4','red2','blue2')) +\n  # Modify Y axis limits and units\n  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0.5,2), labels = scales::unit_format(suffix = 'x')) +\n  # Set the base theme\n  theme_bw(paper =  'gray99', base_family = 'Avenir Next') +\n  # Additional tweaks to the theme \n  theme(\n    # Remove titles from de axis\n    axis.title = element_blank(),\n    # Delete some grids\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    panel.grid.major.x = element_blank(),\n    # Remove legend (recommended to avoid writting to many `show.legend = F`)\n    legend.position = 'none'\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can observe an increase in the average multiplier value for Indonesia after the protest began.

This table will show the average values prior to the Jolly Roger Flag’s protest, as well as the averages after the protest.\nNext, we will calculate the changes over time for each group by subtracting the pre-protest average from the post-protest average. The key row of the table will highlight the difference between these two changes; this is known as the “difference-in-differences” estimate. This estimate represents the intended impact of the intervention. Essentially, this method isolates the portion of the change in the treated group (Indonesia) that exceeds or falls short of the change observed in the control group (the other Southeast and East Asian markets), providing a clear measure of the intervention’s effect.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJolly Roger flag protest\nBefore\nAfter\nAverage Difference\n\n\n\n\nIndonesia\nA\nB\nB - A\n\n\nControl Market\nC\nD\nD - C\n\n\nAverage Difference\nA - C\nB - D\n(B - A) - (D - C)\n\n\n\nWe can easily fill in the first row for our treated market using dplyr syntax.

We can follow the same steps as in our previous analysis, making just a few modifications to our code to complete the rest of the table. After our intervention, we observed that the change in the demand multiplier for the control group was -0.01. By subtracting the average difference of the control group from the average difference of the treated group, we can determine our DiD estimation. Our calculations show that the average impact of the Jolly Roger Flag protest on the demand performance of One Piece resulted in an increase of approximately 0.16 units in the multiplier compared to the average market in Southeast Asia.\n\n\nShow the code\n# Filter our interest market\ndata_se = data %&gt;% \n  filter(market %in% c('Indonesia','Southeast Asia'))\n\n# C cell\nbefore_control = data_se %&gt;% \n  # Control market before intervention\n  filter(treatment == 0, intervention == 0) %&gt;% \n  # Average multiplier\n  summarise(C = mean(region_multiplier)) %&gt;% \n  # Pull the value\n  pull(C)\n\n# D cell\nafter_control = data_se %&gt;% \n  # Control market after intervention\n  filter(treatment == 0, intervention == 1) %&gt;% \n  # Average multiplier\n  summarise(D = mean(region_multiplier)) %&gt;% \n  # Pull the value\n  pull(D)\n\n# Diff in diff estimator\ndiff_in_diff = (after_treatment - before_treatment) - (after_control - before_control)\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 1: My Caption\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJolly Roger flag protest\nBefore\nAfter\nAverage Difference\n\n\n\n\nIndonesia\n1.554\n1.703\n0.149\n\n\nControl Market\n0.756\n0.743\n-0.013\n\n\nAverage Difference\n0.798\n0.96\n0.162\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf we plot our difference-in-differences calculations alongside our previously calculated average, we can confirm that they align with the average observed values we plotted earlier; in fact, they are the same.\n\n\nShow the code\n### diff in diff graph ###\ndid_df = tibble(\n  # Market name\n  market = c('Indonesia', 'Indonesia','Southeast Asia','Southeast Asia'),\n  # Intervention column\n  intervention = c(0 , 1, 0, 1),\n  # Treatment column\n  treatment = c(1, 1, 0, 0),\n  # Calculated valures\n  values = c(before_treatment, after_treatment, before_control, after_control)\n)\n\n# Create a ggplot canvas\nggplot(data = data_se, mapping = aes(x = intervention, y = region_multiplier)) +\n  # Add points with 1.96 se\n  stat_summary(\n    # Add colour\n    mapping = aes(color = 'Observed'), \n    # Additional aesthetics\n    geom = 'pointrange', fun.data = 'mean_se', fun.args = list(mult = 1.96)\n    ) +\n  # Add our calculated averages\n  geom_point(\n    data = did_df, \n    mapping = aes(x = intervention, y = values, col = 'Calculated'), \n    # Modify aesthetics\n    shape = 13, size = 4\n    ) +\n  # Add labels\n  labs(\n     title = ' Average Weekly Demand Expressions™ for One Piece in Southeast and East Asia',\n    subtitle = expression(paste(italic('Before'),' and ', italic('After'),' average demand multiplier (x Times average demand for One Piece in the region)')),\n    caption = 'Source: own elaboration with data from Parrot Analytics\\nAuthor:@renorosgo',\n    color = \"Mean\"       # Legend title\n  ) +\n  # Split by market\n  facet_wrap(~market) + \n  # Modify scales\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(0,1), labels = c('Before', 'After'), limits = c(-0.25,1.25)) +\n  # Modify Y axis limits and units\n  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0.5,2), labels = scales::unit_format(suffix = 'x')) +\n  # Scale color\n  scale_color_manual(values = c('gray50','red2')) +\n  # Set the base theme\n  theme_bw(paper =  'gray99', base_family = 'Avenir Next') +\n  # Additional tweaks to the theme \n  theme(\n    # Remove titles from de axis\n    axis.title = element_blank(),\n    # Delete some grids\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    panel.grid.major.x = element_blank(),\n    legend.position = 'bottom',\n    legend.title = element_blank()\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4\n\n\n\n\n\nA key requirement for the validity of the difference-in-differences method is the parallel trend assumption. This assumption posits that, in the absence of the intervention, the treated group and the control group would have exhibited similar trends or patterns in their outcomes over time. In simpler terms, had there been no changes related to the protest, the demand performance of One Piece in both markets would likely have followed a similar trajectory.\nThis assumption allows us to attribute any differences in trends observed after the intervention to the effect of the Jolly Roger protest, rather than to other factors or inherent differences between the groups. Essentially, it ensures that the only systematic difference noted after the intervention is due to the treatment itself. This validation supports the causal interpretation of the difference-in-differences estimate. The following plot provides a graphic representation of our parallel trend assumption, illustrated with a blue dashed line. The potential impact of the Jolly Roger flag protest in Indonesia is indicated by a vertical red dashed line.\n\n\nShow the code\n# Create a ggplot canvas\nggplot(\n  data = did_df, \n  mapping = aes(x = intervention, y = values, color = market)\n  ) +\n  # Add our initial values\n  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = intervention, y = values)) +\n  # Add the gray shape\n  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = intervention, y = values), shape = 13, size = 4, col = 'gray40') +\n  # Add the original line\n  geom_line() +\n  # Draw the parallel trend\n  annotate(\n    geom = 'segment',\n    # Set coordinates\n    x = 0, xend = 1, y = before_treatment, yend = after_treatment - diff_in_diff,\n    # Set aesthetics\n    linetype = 'dashed', col = 'blue2', linewidth = 0.75\n  ) +\n  # Add vertical gray projection lines\n  annotate(\n    geom = 'segment',\n    # Set coordinates\n    x = c(0,1), xend = c(0,1), y = before_treatment, yend = before_control,\n    # Set aesthetics\n    linetype = 'dotted', col = 'gray50'\n  ) +\n  # Add the potential effect\n  annotate(\n    geom = 'segment',\n    # Set coordinates\n    x = 1, xend = 1, y = before_treatment, yend = after_treatment,\n    # Set aesthetics\n    linetype = 'dashed', col = 'red2', linewidth = 0.75\n  ) +\n  # Add labels\n  labs(\n     title = 'Difference in differences parrallel trend assumption',\n    subtitle = expression(paste(italic('Before'),' and ', italic('After'),' average demand multiplier (x Times average demand for One Piece in the region)')),\n    caption = 'Source: own elaboration with data from Parrot Analytics\\nAuthor:@renorosgo',\n    color = \"Mean\"  \n  ) +\n  # Modify X axis limits and labels\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(0,1), labels = c('Before', 'After'), limits = c(-0.25,1.25)) +\n  # Modify Y axis limits and units\n  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0.5,1.8), labels = scales::unit_format(suffix = 'x')) +\n  # Set colors\n  scale_color_manual(values = c('red2','blue2')) +\n  # Set the base theme\n  theme_bw(paper =  'gray99', base_family = 'Avenir Next') +\n  # Additional tweaks to the theme \n  theme(\n    # Remove titles from de axis\n    axis.title = element_blank(),\n    # Delete some grids\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    panel.grid.major.x = element_blank(),\n    # Remove legend (recommended to avoid writting to many `show.legend = F`)\n    legend.position = 'none'\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5\n\n\n\n\n\nWe want to determine whether the Difference-in-Differences (DiD) estimate of 0.16 is statistically significant. In other words, we aim to confirm that this estimate is genuinely different from zero and not merely a result of random variation.\nLinear regression is an effective method for simultaneously analyzing the combined effects of multiple factors. When applied to a DiD analysis, it considers important information, such as whether a market received the intervention, whether the time period is before or after the intervention, and crucially, whether the market was treated after the change.\nThe fundamental idea is straightforward: we want to mathematically describe our red and blue dashed lines in Figure 2 using the following equation:\n\\[Demand Multiplier = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1intervention + \\beta_2treatment + \\beta_3DiD+\\epsilon\\]\nThe following table displays the results of our linear regression, which uses the average performance of Southeast Asian markets as a control. Notably, the estimates for each variable correspond with those from Table 1. This correlation occurs because linear regression uses matrix operations to estimate the coefficients, ( _i ), centered around the mean.\nThe advantage of conducting this statistical analysis is that it allows us to assess the statistical significance of our findings. As we can observe, the estimate of -0.01 for the intervention variable, which we calculated earlier, is not statistically significant. This means it is not significantly different from zero, indicating that our control market did not experience any change in average performance following the onset of the Jolly Roger flag protest.\nIn contrast, estimates that are statistically significant are considered different from zero. Specifically, our Difference-in-Differences (DiD) estimator indicates an increase of 0.16 units in the multiplier when compared to the control group, which can be attributed to the Jolly Roger flag protest associated with One Piece.\n\n\nShow the code\nmodel_1 = lm(\n  # This is how we input the formula for the regresion model\n  formula = region_multiplier ~ intervention + treatment + `DiD`,\n  # We are using our previously filtered data\n  data = data_se\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDependent variable:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDemand Multiplier\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nintervention\n\n\n-0.013\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(0.038)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntreatment\n\n\n0.798***\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(0.039)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiD\n\n\n0.162***\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(0.053)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConstant\n\n\n0.756***\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(0.028)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObservations\n\n\n30\n\n\n\n\nR2\n\n\n0.977\n\n\n\n\nAdjusted R2\n\n\n0.975\n\n\n\n\nResidual Std.

This DiD term indicates how much of the change in demand can be directly attributed to the intervention, helping to isolate its impact from other influencing factors and providing a clearer understanding of its true effects.\nTo strengthen the validity of the Southeast Asia model, we will estimate a new DiD regression using the average market data from East Asia as our control group. This approach allows us to account for variations in the show’s popularity within the Asian market, such as the release of new episodes or other relevant events. It also helps prevent underestimating the effects due to the influence Indonesia may have had on other Southeast Asian markets, such as Nepal.\nConsistent with the previous model, the East Asia model shows a significant increase of 0.16 units in the multiplier compared to the average East Asian market. Additionally, we do not observe any significant impact from the Jolly Roger flag protest in the control market.\n\n\nShow the code\nmodel_2 = data %&gt;% \n  # Filter to remove the Southeast market\n  filter(market != 'Southeast Asia') %&gt;% \n  # Run the regresion\n  lm(formula = region_multiplier ~ intervention + treatment + `DiD`)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDependent variable:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDemand Multiplier\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSoutheast Asia\n\n\nEast Asia\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(1)\n\n\n(2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nintervention\n\n\n-0.013\n\n\n-0.014\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(0.038)\n\n\n(0.040)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntreatment\n\n\n0.798***\n\n\n0.372***\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(0.039)\n\n\n(0.041)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiD\n\n\n0.162***\n\n\n0.163***\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(0.053)\n\n\n(0.056)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConstant\n\n\n0.756***\n\n\n1.182***\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(0.028)\n\n\n(0.029)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObservations\n\n\n30\n\n\n30\n\n\n\n\nR2\n\n\n0.977\n\n\n0.915\n\n\n\n\nAdjusted R2\n\n\n0.975\n\n\n0.905\n\n\n\n\nResidual Std.

Statistical methods like difference-in-differences support this connection, reminding us that symbols like One Piece embody collective hopes and desires, serving as cultural anchors during times of social upheaval.\nHow significant is One Piece for the Jolly Roger protests in Indonesia? Our analysis reveals that interest in the series surged by nearly 9.5% in response to the protests. Given that the manga has sold over 516 million copies and the anime has amassed millions of viewing hours on platforms like Netflix, this increase underscores how popular culture can unite communities in their shared aspirations for change and justice. Ultimately, this case illustrates that entertainment and storytelling are not merely forms of escapism; they are vital forces that shape social identities and inspire collective action. As societies continue to evolve, embracing these cultural dynamics becomes essential for engaging with and interpreting contemporary social movements.\n\n\nShow the code\ndata %&gt;% \n  filter(market == 'Indonesia') %&gt;% \n  # Create a ggplot canvas\n  ggplot(\n  # Data-related aesthetics\n  mapping = aes(x = date, y = region_multiplier, col = market)\n  ) +\n  # Add vertical line\n  geom_vline(\n    # This is the week when the first flag was shown (at leas in the news)\n    xintercept = c(cutoff),\n    # Modify the aesthetics\n    linetype = 'dashed', col = 'gray60'\n    ) +\n  # Add point\n  geom_point(size = 1, alpha = 0.25) +\n  # Add a dashed line with the average multiplier for the Before\n  geom_xspline(\n    data = filter(data, date &lt; cutoff, market == 'Indonesia') %&gt;% \n      mutate(date = ifelse(date == max(date), cutoff, date)),\n    mapping = aes(x = date, y = region_multiplier, col = market),\n    linewidth = 0.5, alpha = 0.25\n  ) +\n  # Add a dashed line with the average multiplier for the After\n  geom_xspline(\n    data = filter(data, date &gt;= cutoff, market == 'Indonesia'),\n    mapping = aes(x = date, y = region_multiplier, col = market), \n    spline_shape = -0.5, alpha = 0.25\n  ) +\n  # Add a dashed line with the average multiplier for the Before\n  stat_smooth(\n    data = filter(data, date &lt; cutoff, market == 'Indonesia')%&gt;% \n      mutate(date = ifelse(date == max(date), cutoff, date)),\n    mapping = aes(x = date, y = average_multiplier),\n    method = 'lm', linetype = 'dashed', linewidth = 0.75, col = 'red2'\n  ) +\n  # Add a dashed line with the average multiplier for the After\n  stat_smooth(\n    data = filter(data, date &gt;= cutoff, market == 'Indonesia') ,\n    mapping = aes(x = date, y = average_multiplier),\n    method = 'lm', linetype = 'dashed', linewidth = 0.75, col = 'red2'\n  ) +\n  annotate(\n  geom = 'segment',\n    x = cutoff, xend = cutoff,\n    y = before_treatment, yend = after_treatment,\n    col = 'red2', linewidth = 1\n  ) +\n  annotate(\n    geom = 'point',\n    x = cutoff, y = c(before_treatment, after_treatment), \n    shape = 18, size = 4, col = 'red2'\n  ) +\n  # Annotate the relevant text\n  annotate(\n    # Use GeomRichtext as geom\n    geom = ggtext::GeomRichtext,\n    # Set coordinates\n    x = cutoff - 1, y = after_treatment,\n    # Html and linked to data format\n    label = sprintf(\n        fmt = \n          \"A &lt;span style='color:black'&gt;**%s%% increase** in One Piece performance&lt;br&gt;can be attributed to the Jolly Roger flag protest&lt;/span&gt;\",\n        round(x = 100 * diff_in_diff/after_treatment, digits = 2)\n    ),\n    # Set aesthetics\n    size = 2.5, hjust = 1, vjust = 0.5, color = 'red2', \n  ) +\n  # Add labels\n  labs(\n    title = 'Weekly Demand for One Piece in Indonesia',\n    subtitle = 'Overall Southeast and East Asia demand multiplier (x Times average demand for One Piece)',\n    caption = 'Source: own elaboration with data from Parrot Analytics\\nAuthor:@renorosgo'\n  ) +\n  # Modify colors\n  scale_color_manual(values = c('red2')) +\n  # Modify Y axis limits and units\n  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(1.45,1.85), labels = scales::unit_format(suffix = 'x')) +\n  scale_x_date(date_labels = \"%d-%b-%y\", date_breaks = \"2 weeks\") +\n  # Set the base theme\n  theme_bw(paper =  'gray99', base_family = 'Avenir Next') +\n  # Additional tweaks to the theme \n  theme(\n    # Remove titles from de axis\n    axis.title = element_blank(),\n    # Delete some grids\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    panel.grid.major.x = element_blank(),\n    # Remove legend (recommended to avoid writting to many `show.legend = F`)\n    legend.position = 'none'\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6"
